## Strategy #1 - Uniswap New Pair 

#### Idea - Constantly lookout for new pairs added to Uniswap. If the pair is new or has very low mcap, then do a background manual check on following
	
	
	1) Website
	2) Idea and Opportunity size
	3) Research team background
	4) Coingecko listing
	5) Social channels (follower counts, activities in chat)
	
	
	
If all 5 looks okay, then invest in that pair
